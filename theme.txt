the story would be a thriller. we have to make new branches and add new file named as storyline. every branch then would be merged to the main branch after a pull request. if any member wants to work on other member's storyline, he would be required to solve his merge conflicts locally and then push upstream to the remote branch and then make a pull request. if there is any doubt, we can open a google doc to discuss git strategies.
